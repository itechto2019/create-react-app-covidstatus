                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused<br/> 
                        by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19<br/>
                        will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special<br/>
                        treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical<br/>
                        attention.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        How it spreads?
                        The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small<br/>
                        liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.<br/> 
                        These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.<br/>
                        You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who<br/> 
                        has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then<br/>
                        your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors<br/>
                        and in crowded settings.
